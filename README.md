# PathWise

PathWise is an AI-powered career guidance platform designed to help Nigerian students discover career paths that align with their interests, skills, and personal values. Built using the [Bolt](https://bolt.new) no-code platform, PathWise was created during a 48-hour hackathon sprint focused on building scalable, impactful solutions for young people in Africa.

## 🌍 Why PathWise?

In Nigeria, many students are pressured into choosing career paths without clarity or personalized guidance. Most rely on generic advice like “go into nursing, engineering, or law,” without deeper alignment to their passions or aptitudes .PathWise guides users through self-discovery by asking structured questions and offering curated insights. It draws inspiration from behavioral psychology and aims to eventually integrate AI-powered recommendations.

PathWise was originally developed by two members of our current team (Emmanuel and OG) during a previous student hackathon, where it earned first place. That experience validated the core idea and inspired us to take the project further. 

For this hackathon, we restructured the team and refined the vision to build a more scalable, user-friendly version of PathWise, introducing new features, improved design, and a cleaner architecture.
