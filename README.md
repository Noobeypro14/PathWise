# PathWise

PathWise is a dynamic career exploration assistant designed to help individuals especially students navigate their career paths with clarity and confidence. Built during a hackathon in less than 48 hours using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), PathWise provides an easy-to-use interface for discovering career options tailored to user preferences.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Choosing a career path can be overwhelming, especially for individuals unsure about how their interests align with real-world job options. Generic advice like "just do nursing or engineering" dominates, leaving many young people feeling boxed in and under-informed.

## 🧭 What PathWise Does

PathWise simplifies the career discovery journey by asking the user a short set of personalized questions and suggesting suitable fields based on their interests and traits.

### Key Features

- 📋 **Dynamic Form Flow**: Users go through an interactive decision-tree questionnaire to determine compatible fields.
- 🧠 **Tailored Suggestions**: The app suggests career domains such as UI/UX, cybersecurity, nursing, etc., based on preferences.
- 💻 **No-Code MVP**: Built entirely with [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), allowing for rapid development and deployment.

> 🛠️ **Note**: This is a working prototype aimed at demonstrating the *idea and interaction flow*, not full data logic or backend execution.
